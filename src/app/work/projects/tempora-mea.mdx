## Description

The melancholy, the brevity of expression, and the delicate rhythmic musical sound of the poetry by Theodor Storm, Franz Werfel, and Thomas Altpeter intertwine in their unique and impressionistic way with the music of Kirsti Alho, which incorporates improvisational elements of jazz and contemporary music.

With this project, they have found a new way of free expression and new forms through their own compositions and agreements on structures, without forgetting the melodic flow of the texts.

## Concept

The myth of everyday life with ambivalent emotions in Franz Werfel’s poetry, the melancholy and brevity of expression in Theodor Storm’s works, and the classical poetry-inspired verses of Thomas Altpeter create a new formal context. Content-wise, they combine images of nature with dreamlike associations and aphoristic thoughts.
